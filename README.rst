# Gen_Image_method

A toy project to create a generic image processing package.

The project consist of two main parts:
1) Image enhancement via Machine learning, and
2) Error detection and correction methods in image processing.

The aim of this project is to create a set of useful functions and network for more in-depth project related to Astronomical image processing or Atomic force microscpy in the future.

At the moment, few functions on source detection and deconvolution are built.

Quick Examples
==============
Adding bright sparks

.. code:: python
	import noise_handling as N
	from skimage import color, data, restoration
	
	# Load image
	Image = color.rgb2gray(data.immunohistochemistry())
	
	# Add sparks to the frame
	sparky = N.add_spark(Image, spark_num =20, connect_pix= 400)
	
	# Plot the image+ sparks
	N.plot_three_frame(Image,sparky, astro+sparky,
                'Original Data', 'Sparks', "Composed Image")
.. image::

Source detection
.. code:: python
	# Detecting bright sources
	bright_spot = source_detect(astro+sparky)
	
	# Plot the detection
	draw_ellipses(astro+sparky, bright_spot,astro)
